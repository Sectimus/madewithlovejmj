# MadeWithLove
## Made with Love is a a web application that makes it easy for everyday individuals to reach out and interact with ‘Made With Love’.

*Made with Love started in July 2016 when we became aware of families struggling to
feed their children during the school holidays.
Initially we started with donations from family and friends to make packed lunches in
our homes and we distributed to local groups who provided care for children during
the holidays.
At Christmas 2016 we were able to provide 55 Christmas Hampers, to 3 local
schools. The Hampers provide a full Christmas Dinner with all the trimmings and
some special extras to help a family celebrate the Festive Season. Each Hamper
costs £40. They are gift wrapped and presented to the families via the schools during
the last week of term.*

### 2017
*We realised that our Project was going to grow very quickly, and we needed to find
local premises.
We have been supported by Fr Martin of St Stephen’s Parish, Dalmuir and he gave
us permission to run our project from St. Stephen’s Hall. The hall is vast and has a
large industrial kitchen. We also have full use of a large storage area.
We received a Grant from West Dunbartonshire Community Fund and Radio Clyde
Cash for Kids. This allowed us to buy a fridge and freezer and other items to help us
expand our packed lunches and open a community café.
During the Summer we provided over 1,200 packed lunches and ran our Community
Café. This provided families in the local area with a place to come for lunch.
Our packed lunches come in a bag and include 2 pieces of fruit, juice, roll with
cheese/ham, breakfast bar and a packet of crisps. It cost £1.30 per lunch.
Our Community café provides homemade soup, sandwiches, scones, cakes, fruit
and tea/coffee. It is free and open to everyone.
In October we approached all 14 primary schools in the Clydebank area in order to
identify the number of needy families who would benefit from the hampers. We
subsequently provided 174 Hampers.
We enlisted the assistance of pupils from St. Peter the Apostle High School and
friends and family to help prepare the hampers and distribute them.*

### 2018
*During the summer of 2018 we again ran our very successful and busy Community
Café alongside providing and distributing over 2,000 packed lunches, to local groups
who work with children during the school holidays and individuals who attend our
café or just drop in. We also provided packed lunches to our local Foodbank who
distributed to families in need.
We received a Grant from Cash for Kids and again we received donations from
friends, family and many other people. This allowed us to approach all the schools in
Clydebank including Secondary Schools and Additional Support Schools to identify
families that would benefit from a Christmas Hamper. We were inundated with
requests and we provided 261 hampers.
We still have the support of the St. Peter the Apostle school children and have
enlisted many willing volunteers to help us pack the Hampers and wrap them. The
schools are now uplifting the Hampers as our project is too big now for us to deliver.*

### April 2019
*This year during the 2 weeks of the April school break we ran our packed lunches
and Café on a Wednesday and Friday from St. Stephen’s Hall, Dalmuir. This was
the first time we have opened at this time of year. It turned out to be such a success
that we had to expand our Café area into the main hall in St Stephens.
We were supported by Cash for Kids and Fareshare.
This allowed us to pilot a Pantry. We had a well-stocked Pantry which allowed
people to pick up some shopping if they wanted or needed it. It was £1 for any 5
items but was free to anyone who could not afford to pay*

### Summer 2019
*This year we extended our services to run for 5 weeks during the Summer Holidays.
We also introduced a Pantry allowing people to have access to fresh fruit, veg, cold
meat, cheese and non-perishable goods. We offered this to people at 5 items for £1.
We expanded into Faifley offering packed lunches, our Café and a Pantry on a
Monday from St Joseph’s Hall.
It was a great success and was well received by the Community of Faifley and
Duntocher.
We were able to establish a link with St Mary’s St Vincent de Paul Group who came
and were able to help families in need.
We were supported by Faifley Community Council who regularly attended.
It was a great success and although we are tackling food poverty during the school
holidays and our premises are in Church Halls, everyone is welcome. Children must
be accompanied by an adult and we have activities available for children both inside
the halls and outside. It is a friendly environment and our aim is to bring together
people within their communities.
We continued our services from St Stephen’s Hall on a Wednesday and Friday.
Again, we ran our Pantry and it was very well received.
During the summer we made up and distributed over 2000 packed lunches to local
groups who provided care for children during the holidays. Packed lunches were
also made available in both halls for families to uplift for their children.
Our Cafes served lunches of homemade soup, sandwiches, cakes, scones and fruit
by buffet service. We provided over 700 lunches within both halls.
Our packed lunches and Cafés are free and open to everyone. If people gave a
small donation, we were very grateful.
We did not have the support of Fareshare during the summer as their funding for
families ended on 31st July.
We received a Grant from WDC and Cash for Kids which helped us continue and
develop our services.
We rely on volunteers and this year as well as our regular volunteers we had a chef
who gave his time to help us to expand and improve our services.
We had 10 young people between the ages of 12 and 16 who helped us. We gave
them training on how to serve people and how to set tables. This was received well
by their parents who were happy for them to be involved. They have grown in
confidence and now work well as a team and show great enthusiasm. Everyone
who attended gave them glowing reviews.
On the last day of our Café we decided to
have a celebration day.
We decorated the hall in St Stephen’s with
chair covers and made it an afternoon tea.
Everyone was welcome and we served 160
people. We served sausage rolls,
sandwiches, cakes and scones. We
approached a local group who came and
entertained everyone with their singing. We
also had 2 of our young volunteers
entertaining the crowd with their Irish dancing. Everyone had a great afternoon and
it was a great way to end our successful summer.*

### Christmas Hampers 2019
*We have already contacted all Clydebank Schools to identify families who would
benefit from a Christmas Hamper.
Last year we packed, wrapped and distributed 261 Hampers to families in Clydebank
through the network of schools.
We expect the numbers to be about the same this year and as last year it cost us
over £10,000, we are working hard to secure Grants and donations from our loyal
and local supporters.
We have had a meeting with Aldi who will again supply us with all the food. Aldi do
not give us a discount as they already support other charities and that decision is
made at their head office.
The service we get from Aldi is fantastic and the prices for food are very reasonable.
That is why we continue to work with them.
This year they will be giving us the Vouchers for School when we purchase our
orders and, they will be putting aside vouchers that customers do not want, and we
will distribute them to the schools.
We will be packing our Hampers in St Stephen’s Hall on Mondays on 11th and 18th
November 2nd, 9th, 16th and Tuesday 17th December.
We continue to include local people to help and we also work closely with the High
Schools for their S6 pupils to come and be involved.
Everything we do is for the people and with the people in the Clydebank Community.*
